# Entry 05

I wanted to implement a login-logout functionality in my app. I know this can be done by using Redux. I stated to learn Redux, I took a look at some demo/hello-world Redux apps, but after a while I stopped digging into this. The reason is that soon there will be January and the end of this course and I’m afraid I wouldn’t have enough time to learn Redux and to implement the login functionality. Therefore I decided to focus on just React and React-Router. 

Instead of a login-logout, I created a functionality where the user can add or remove notes to each item in the application. It is possible to add a note (or many notes) and to remove all notes at once. I wanted to create a button where the user could remove just one note, but I didn’t manage to implement this. There were some problems with Reactfire and binding that I couldn’t overcome, and after a few hours I decided to skip this and to implement a button where the user can delete all notes at once. 

I also switched to webpack. It feels a bit better than browserify because it seems to be a bit faster. I also started to learn ES6 syntax and I started to rewrite my components from ES5 to ES6. 

My next steps will be to fix a react-router history problem that I have in my app and if I have time left I will implement some more functionalities to the app.
