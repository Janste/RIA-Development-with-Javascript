# Entry 04

During the last two weeks I dug deeper into React and I have also learned React Router basics. One of the worst things about learning React is that there are not many tutorials out there on the internet. And if I manage to find one - it’s out of date! The development of this tool goes quite fast forward. Therefore I have to perform a lot of trial and error on my own when developing my app, and because of that the progress is very slow (but little progress is of course better than no progress at all). 

I’m still not sure what I would like to do for my final project, but right now I’m developing something like my own Wiki webpage. Currently my app has a home page, a search function and it can also display items that were found during the search. I’m using Firebase for my persistent storage.
