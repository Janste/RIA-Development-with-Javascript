# Entry 02

Because I have never programmed in Javascript before, the first thing I did was to read about it. Once I understood the basics of this language I started to read about React. I have not read so much about Redux and React Router yet. I also played a little bit with the demo app that is provided in this course.

Thanks to tutorials that I found on the internet I managed to create a small hello world application and I published it on Github pages. This app only shows ”Hello World!” text and a link below this text. Clicking that link will display an alert message.

I’m still not sure what kind of project I want to create. I think I still need to read more about React, Redux and React router, to find out what kind of possibilities these tools give and then decide what to do on my project.
