# Final blog post

This is my last blog post. I think that this course is very good in general. I have learnt a lot. 

Before this course started I didn't know Javascript. Now I know not only Javascript, but also React. I liked the way this course is organized, that we could learn and explore React on our own. 

The biggest challenge for me was that I have never programmed in Javascript before this course. I had to quickly learn this language before I could start learning about React. Because of this I didnâ€™t have much time to explore Redux. 

In general, I liked this course.
