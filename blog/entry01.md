# Entry 01

Hello, my name is Jan Steczko and I study Software Technology in Växjö. Before I started studying here at LNU I was working as an IT assistant. I was mainly taking phone calls, helping people fix their computer or printer, etc. After 2 years working as such IT consultant I thought that I would like to do something else in my life and I decided to study programming.

Right now I only know how to program in Java and PHP and I also know a bit about Android programming. I hope I will learn a lot about Javascript in this course. I like acquiring new technical skills and learning about software technology in general.

During my spare time, if I’m not coding then I’m usually exercising at the gym, reading a book, watching a movie or doing all the other usual stuff.
