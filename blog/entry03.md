# Entry 03

During this week I have learnt mostly about Javascript, not React. I decided to do so because I wanted to understand how Javascript works and learn its syntax before going in for something more advanced. As I said in my first blog post, I have never used Javascript before so I wanted to learn the basics first.

I read the chapters about Javascript inside the ”Learning PHP, MySQL, Javascript, CSS and HTML5” book by Robin Nixon. It was about 200 pages. After that I created a few small Javascript applications which can be found here on my GitHub:

I also read more about Node.js. In the beginning I didn’t know what it is so I decided to read and watch some tutorials about it. The most helpful tutorial about Node.js was this video series from YouTube:

Now I understand the basics of Javascript and Node.js and I think now I’m ready to start digging deeper into React.
